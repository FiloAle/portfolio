Looper is an urban redevelopment project aimed at transforming the former hippodrome area in Milan into a vibrant new neighborhood.
This initiative focuses on creating a modern, sustainable, and inclusive community space that integrates residential, commercial,
and recreational facilities. By repurposing the old racetrack site, Looper aspires to enhance the urban landscape and provide a high
quality of life for its future residents. As with any project that has to deal with several thousands of people, Looper needed an
identity too: that's why we've developed a brand image that could summarize in a simple logotype the essence of the future district.

This logo has been inspired by the hippodrome's shape, and it's expected to be applied on many visual supports (such as construction
fences, social network posts, signs and more). Down below you can see one of a series of possible visual applications based on shapes
and patterns directly derived from the de-construction of the original stretched loop.

Of course, the new neighborhood would also need a wayfinding system, based on its visual identity. For this reason we've developed
a series of _sub-brands_ such as Looper Park, Looper Fitness and Looper Market. The project is also expected to have a dedicated
website.

    <div className="relative col-span-1 row-span-2">
        <Image
        alt={`Looper wayfinding system`}
        title={`Looper wayfinding system`}
        src={`/images/Looper/cartelli.png`}
        fill
        sizes="(max-width: 768px) 213px, 33vw"
        className="object-cover rounded-lg"
        />
    </div>

    <div className="relative col-span-1 row-span-2">
        <Image
        alt={`Looper website`}
        title={`Looper website`}
        src={`/images/Looper/sito.png`}
        fill
        sizes="(max-width: 768px) 213px, 33vw"
        className="object-cover rounded-lg"
        />
    </div>

The Looper project would also need to be promoted and widespread among the local communities. For this reason we've
developed a series of physical touchpoints such as _call to action_ posters.

    title={`Looper call to action poster`}
    src={`/images/Looper/cta-poster.png`}
    width={4000}
    height={3000}
/>

The new neighborhood is also expected to have a unique "open market", for which we've designed some custom shopping bags.
