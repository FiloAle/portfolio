HEEP is a speculative design project that has been developed throughout a series of steps:

- [Defining the speculative context](#defining-the-speculative-context)
- [Developing HEEP's brand identity](#developing-heeps-brand-identity)
- [Programming Arduino and its WebApp](#programming-arduino-and-its-webapp)

## Defining the speculative context

As every speculative design project does, HEEP lives in its own futuristic but plausible context too.
Its name stands for _Holding for the Electrical Energy from Potatoes_ and it consists in a fictionary company that aims to solve,
at least in part, the potato overproduction problem. Every year, in fact, we waste more than 57mln tons of spuds, but we also
know that potatoes contain an acid that can lead to the exchange of electrons between a copper and a zinc electrodes,
resulting in the production of small electric charges.

Because of this specific principle, HEEP developed Qubo, a domestic electricity generator powered by potatoes. Activate your audio and watch the brand reel that sums it up down below!

## Developing HEEP's brand identity

HEEP's identity, as you've probably already seen from the previous video, aims to reach the broadest audience possible by adopting 
a colorful visual communication and a catchy tone of voice in its copywrite. The main goal, in fact, is involving the greatest number
of people in HEEP's community, in order to save as many potatoes as possible from being wasted.

HEEP's users from all over the world are able to contribute to the cause by buying and using Qubo, powering on their favorite modules and lighting up their homes
while helping the global community, at the same time, in reaching its goal.


## Programming Arduino and its WebApp

We, as HEEP, have also realized a proper working prototype of Qubo using Arduino and other technologies such as PHP to create the relative WebApp.
More specifically, I've managed to develop the software that powers it all. Here you can take a look at some code snippets from the project:

```cpp
if(digitalRead(15) == HIGH) {
  if(firstLaunch) {
    sendData("api_key=" + apiKeyValue
            + "&action=ins"
            + "&sessionid=" + currentID
            + "&genkp=" + genkp
            + "&npot=" + npot);

    savedData.begin("IDs", false);
    currentID = savedData.getInt("lastID") + 1;
    savedData.putInt("lastID", currentID);
    savedData.end();

    displayFirstPage();

    firstLaunch = false;
  }
  ...
}
```

This is an extract of code from QuboScreen, a module of the prototype based on ESP32 that sends Qubo's electric production data to a database.
The database has a key role in making the experience feel complete, in fact it stores a series of informations that every user
can freely access from their personal area on <a href="https://heepenergia.it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heepenergia.it</a>,
a sort of a WebApp currently optimized for mobile displays only. By registering on the website, each user is able associate their personal Qubo 
usage session with their own account and see the statistics being updated in real time, thanks to QuboScreen and its database integration.

Down below, on the other hand, you can read a snippet of PHP code from the login page that checks users' data.

```php
if(isset($_SESSION['userid'])) {
  header('location:user_page.php');
}

if(isset($_POST['login'])) {
  $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['username']);
  $pass = md5($_POST['password']);

  $select = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' && password = '$pass'";
  $result = mysqli_query($conn, $select);

  if(mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    $userData = $result->fetch_array();

    $_SESSION['username'] = $userData['username'];
    $_SESSION['userid'] = $userData['userid'];
    header('location:user_page.php');
  } else {
    $error[] = 'Wrong username or password.';
  }
};
```
